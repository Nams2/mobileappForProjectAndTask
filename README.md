This is a simple mobile app which is built using Meteor, Ionic, angular js, MongoDB, html, css, bootstrap.
It is a task manager. You can add as many project you want. In each project you can add task. 
On click of project name, the related task will only be displayed. MongoDB is used for storing these project and task.
I have also added login and sign up functionality.
